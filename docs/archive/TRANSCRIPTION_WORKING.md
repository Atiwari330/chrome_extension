# ðŸŽ‰ Transcription is Working!

## What We Fixed

The transcription was actually working all along! The service worker was successfully:
- âœ… Connecting to Deepgram
- âœ… Sending audio data
- âœ… Receiving transcriptions ("I'm testing this. I'm testing this.")

The issue was that the transcriptions weren't reaching the UI because of incorrect message passing.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Message Passing**
   - Changed from `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`
   - Now tracks the active tab ID when transcription starts
   - Messages are sent directly to the specific tab

2. **Audio Level Updates**
   - Direct updates to the UI without going through message passing
   - Should now show real-time audio levels

3. **Connection Status**
   - Status indicator should now change colors properly
   - Green = connected, Orange = connecting, Red = error

## Testing Steps

1. **Reload the Extension**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click the refresh button on your extension

2. **Join Google Meet**
   - Make sure you're in an active meeting
   - Wait for the floating widget to appear

3. **Start Recording**
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Watch for:
     - Status indicator turning green
     - Audio level meters moving when you speak
     - **Your transcriptions appearing in the "You" section!**

4. **Speak Clearly**
   - The transcriptions should appear in real-time
   - There might be a 1-2 second delay

## Troubleshooting

If transcriptions still don't appear:
1. Check the service worker console for "Transcription (user):" messages
2. Make sure your API key is set (you already have it)
3. Speak louder and clearer
4. Check that your microphone isn't muted

## What You Should See

- Connection status: Green indicator
- Audio levels: Moving bars when you speak
- Transcriptions: Your words appearing in the "You" section
- Service worker logs: "Transcription (user): [your words]"

The hard part is done - audio capture and Deepgram integration are working perfectly!
